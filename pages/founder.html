                    <h3>Emmy Award-Winning Journalist | TV Host | Producer | Speaker</h3>
                    <p>Oprah Winfrey. Tyler Perry. Julia Roberts. Robert De Niro. Denzel Washington. Tom Cruise. The Rock. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex. For over two decades, Ojinika Obiekwe has been in the room with some of the world's biggest names—interviewing, reporting, and telling their stories like no one else can.</p>
                    <p>A bonafide "celebrity whisperer," Ojinika—known affectionately as Oji or "The Ojinika" on social media—started her career at the multi-Emmy Award-winning WPIX-TV in New York City, where she spent over 20 years cracking up, stumping, and connecting with A-list celebrities, politicians, and newsmakers.
                    Now, she's taking center stage with a groundbreaking new project that will reach audiences across two continents, including Africa's largest network.</p>
                    <p>From Hollywood to Africa and beyond, Oji is forever team "have story, will travel." Whether bouncing between NYC and Lagos or being tapped to host a fundraising event in Nigeria for Prince Harry's Invictus Games Foundation during his and Meghan Markle's first-ever trip to the country, she brings a fresh, witty, and unforgettable presence to every room.</p>
                    <h4>The Journey to Center Stage</h4>
                    <p>Born and raised in Enugu, Nigeria, Oji always had the "gift of gab." After moving to the U.S. to study Broadcast Journalism at Seton Hall University, she landed an internship at WPIX-TV—and never left. Over two decades, she worked her way from intern to Assignment Editor to Producer to Entertainment Correspondent, earning a National Association of Black Journalists fellowship along the way. Her on-camera debut covering global issues in Senegal was the moment she knew: this was what she was born to do.</p>
                    <p>Tamsen Fadal, multiple Emmy Award-winning journalist, former WPIX anchor, and Oji's mentor at the station, saw it from the start:
                    "It was clear that Oji was a star in the making from the moment she started at WPIX. Funny, witty, personable, beautiful, diligent, and eager to learn, she was an immediate standout in the newsroom and on the red carpet—easily gliding over the years from intern to on-camera personality in the number one news market in the country, like no one does. Soon, the world will get to see what we New Yorkers have always known—just how talented and brilliant she is, beneath her genuine humility."</p>
                    <h4>Beyond the Red Carpet</h4>
                    <p>As the founder of the B.O.O.P Group of Companies (By Ojinika Obiekwe Productions), headquartered in Switzerland with locations in the U.S. and Nigeria, Oji is dedicated to storytelling that uplifts, entertains, and inspires. With her latest groundbreakkng project, she's bringing a bold new perspective to entertainment, lifestyle, and culture—showcasing the best the world has to offer while shining a positive light on global stories that matter.</p>
                    <p>"There's nothing we're not going to touch—so long as it's fun and puts goodness out in the world."</p>
                    <p>Ojis highly anticipated new show will debut on two continents, including Africa's largest network, with additional international distribution in the works.</p>
